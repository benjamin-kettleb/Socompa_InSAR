# Socompa_InSAR
InSAR Data analysis over Socompa, Chile. Analysis is focused around how the deformation at Socompa was effected by 2 earthquakes; a M6.8 on the 3rd of June 2020 and a M7.4 on the 19th of July 2024. A previous 2023 paper by F. Liu et al. was released studying deformation onset at Socompa found no causal link (First Onset of Unrest Captured at Socompa: A Recent Geodetic Survey at Central Andean Volcanoes in Northern Chile - https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL102480). This work will increase the data processed over Socompa and further analysis around both the previously studied M6.8 earthquake and the recent M7.4 Earthquake
